# Remastered Controls Collection

A collection of dual analog patches for PSP games on Adrenaline

## Installation

For all plugins below, you should install them by copying to `ux0:pspemu/seplugins` and adding their path to `ux0:pspemu/seplugins/game.txt`, for example:

```
ms0:/seplugins/gta_remastered.prx 1
```

Additionally, ensure the right analog stick isn't mapped to any controls.
